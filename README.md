## Use

`cd  && git clone  https://github.com/codekeeperjava/vimconf.git && cd vimconf && ./install.sh`

## Dependence

1. tagbar depends on ctags
2. smartim depends on im-select

## Optition

1. `ale` It is too big, if you don’t need to check the syntax, you don’t need to install it.
2. `smartim` On the remote server, you don’t need to install it.
